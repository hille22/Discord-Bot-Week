# Discord-Bot-Week

This is a repo made during a Workshop Week. Everyday is a different exercice working with the chat of discord, robot.js, electron.js and emojis ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–. 

Don't forget to put your **Discord Key** or **Tenor Key** here : 

```javascript
function initBot(){
    const { DiscordBotRobot } = require('./DiscordBotRobot');
    new DiscordBotRobot("YourDiscordKey",
    win
    );
}
```

And Run `npm install` for install dependencies
